      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I got my hands on my first computer (a Commodore 64 in the mid-80s), I’ve always loved programming. At
first, it was because I had no idea what else one would use such a machine for, and later because it became a tool
for creative expression. Turning ideas and thoughts into a program feels, for me, like a process similar to the
release others might find in painting, music, or ceramics—though, admittedly, without quite the same fascination
from others!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
